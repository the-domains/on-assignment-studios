  You hear their sirens. You see the flashing lights. You see them working as
  you pass by on the freeway. You may have had to call them for help. Their
  story is one of service and sacrifice. We tell their story.

You hear their sirens. You see the flashing lights. You see them working as you pass by on the freeway. You may have had to call them for help. Their story is one of service and sacrifice. We tell their story. 

EMTs and Paramedics dedicate their lives to rendering aid to those in need and preserving the lives of their fellow citizens. While you work, eat, enjoy family, and sleep; they wait for the call to care. 

On Assignment Studios tells the story of these healthcare professionals and those who support them in their mission.
